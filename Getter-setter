Getters: Setting up a getter allow us to override what happens when an Object property is looked up.
Instead of looking for a property value, JS will run the function and use the value the function returns.

Setters: A setter allows us to override what happens when object property is set. This can be useful if we want
to validate or sanitize data. It can also be useful if you need to do something unique with the value.
