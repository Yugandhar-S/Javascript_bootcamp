# Javascript_Arrays Section 6

In this section, you are going to explore arrays in javascript. Arrays allows us to store a list of items. This could be a list of strings, numbers,objects, or any other typein Javascript.

Arrays are essential to software development. If we take an example of email appp. It is a list of conversations, and each conversation has a list os messages. What about accounting sodtware? It's a list of clients, a lis of expense, and a list of income.

Lists are everywhere, and getting comfortable with them is going to be important if the goal is to create useful applications

This sub-branch will be a challenge project which will be build alongside as I learn about arrays in notes.js. The note.js is a note taking app which was coded alongside the tutor.

The todo.js is a challenge assignment, whatever concepts were learnt in note.js are used in this file. Both the note.js and todo.js will be improved as I learn more about Javascript

As i move accross the topics, there will be parallel development, i.e what i learnt in notes.js will be implemented as a challenge in this project.

The expense-tracker.js is a expense tracker which takes in input from the user, it calculates the total expense,income and balance.
