# Javascript_Arrays
This repo will hold all the codes I will be writing during the learning process of Javascript

There are sub-branches divided into specific sections in which files will be added as the course proceeds.

This repo and Javascript bootcamp I am currently undergoing starts from scratch and builds up gradually to cover all the features of the language, and then using all those features together to create a complete application.
